![CI](https://github.com/JigSawFr/tipi-store/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is a custom repository for the Runtipi.io App Store.
It contains a variety of apps.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run these apps and not the other app(s) in stores that already exist?** Good question!

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* These app's runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other apps run everything as root
>* These app's image are created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* These app's contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other app's images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
>* This repository has an auto update feature that will automatically build the latest version if released.
>* These app's images are smaller than most other AppStore's images

> [!WARNING]
> If you use this appstore, please keep in mind that it is a hobby project and I have very limited spare time for it. I'll try my best to keep apps up to date and in a working configuration, but I can make no guarantees. I will not be constantly responding to user support requests. I may also delete or deprecate an app at any time.
