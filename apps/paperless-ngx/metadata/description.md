## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
- **Document Security**: Documents are stored in plain text without encryption. Run only on trusted networks.
- **Admin Account**: Create admin credentials via the web interface or environment variables
- **OCR Languages**: Install additional language packs if needed for your documents
- **Consume Folder**: Drop new documents in the consume folder for automatic processing
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups are essential - documents and database should be backed up
- **Resource Usage**: OCR processing can be CPU intensive, ensure adequate resources
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions on mounted volumes (uid/gid 1000)

### Getting Started:
1. Access Paperless-ngx at `http://your-tipi-ip:8000`
2. Create admin account if not set via environment variables
3. Configure OCR languages and document types
4. Drop documents in the consume folder or upload via web interface
5. Review and tag processed documents
