## üê≥ DOCKER IMAGE DETAILS

- **Image**: `need4swede/portall:2.0.4`
- **Base**: Python 3.11 Slim
- **Architecture**: Multi-arch support (AMD64, ARM64)
- **User**: Runs as non-root user with configurable UID/GID
- **Security**: Hardened container with minimal privileges
- **Dependencies**: Includes netcat and nmap for port scanning functionality
- **Socket Proxy**: Uses `11notes/socket-proxy:stable` for secure Docker API access

## üìÅ VOLUMES

- **Application Data**: `${APP_DATA_DIR}/data` ‚Üí `/app/instance` (SQLite database and application data)

## üóÉÔ∏è DEFAULT PARAMETERS

- **Port**: 8080 (configurable via Runtipi)
- **Database**: SQLite (automatically created)
- **Docker Integration**: Enabled by default
- **Secret Key**: Auto-generated secure random key
- **User/Group**: 1000:1000 (configurable)
- **Health Check**: Automatic health monitoring every 30s with curl test

## üìù ENVIRONMENT

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `PORTALL_SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for session security | Auto-generated | Yes |
| `PORTALL_DOCKER_ENABLED` | Enable Docker API integration features | `true` | No |
| `PORTALL_HOST_IP` | IP address of your host for port scanning | Auto-detected | No |
| `USER_ID` | User ID for file permissions | `1000` | No |
| `GROUP_ID` | Group ID for file permissions | `1000` | No |
| `TZ` | Timezone for application logs | System timezone | No |

**Note**: The secret key is automatically generated using a secure random hex string for maximum security. User and group IDs are configurable for optimal file permission compatibility with your host system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

- **First Launch**: The application will create its SQLite database automatically on first run
- **Data Persistence**: Ensure the data volume is properly mounted to preserve your port configurations
- **Docker Integration**: Docker functionality uses a secure socket proxy (`11notes/socket-proxy`) for safe API access
- **Socket Proxy**: Automatic deployment with read-only Docker socket access and minimal permissions
- **Port Scanning**: Network scanning features may require additional network permissions
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks ensure service availability with 30-second intervals
- **Backup**: Use the built-in export feature to backup your port configurations as JSON
- **Security**: The application runs as a non-root user with minimal privileges for enhanced security
- **Performance**: SQLite database provides fast performance for most use cases
- **Network Access**: The application can scan and discover ports on your network when Docker integration is enabled
