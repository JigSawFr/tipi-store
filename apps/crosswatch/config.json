  "description": "CrossWatch is a synchronization engine that keeps your Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, SIMKL, Trakt and MDBlist in sync. It runs locally with a clean web UI where you link accounts, define sync pairs, run them manually or on a schedule, and review stats and history. Features include one-way or two-way watchlist/history/ratings sync, live scrobbling via webhooks or watcher, an internal tracker for snapshots/backups, a unified watchlist view, and an analyzer to find stuck or inconsistent items.",
